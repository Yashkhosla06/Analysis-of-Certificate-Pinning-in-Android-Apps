# Analysis of Certificate Pinning in Android Apps

## Overview
This project, submitted for INSE 6110: Foundations of Cryptography (Winter 2023), analyzes the implementation of TLS certificate pinning in Android applications to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. The report investigates both static and dynamic analysis techniques across 100 Android apps.

## Certificate Pinning
Certificate pinning is a security measure that binds an SSL/TLS certificate or public key to a specific server or domain, ensuring that client applications only communicate with servers that have the predefined certificate or key.

### Types of Certificate Pinning
1. **Hard Pinning**: Hardcoding the server's certificate's public key or hash directly into the client's code.
2. **Soft Pinning**: Utilizing the client's trust store to verify the server's certificate chain.

## Methodology
### Static Analysis
- **Download APK Files**: APK files were downloaded from the web.
- **Extract Build Files**: Using `apktool` to extract and inspect network configurations.
- **Code Inspection**: Searching for certificates and related configurations within the application files.

### Dynamic Analysis
We utilized Burp Suite Community Edition and Android Emulator API for dynamic analysis. For proxy configuration, we followed the setup method provided by Burp Suite [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/mobile/config-android-device). We analyzed each app to determine if certificate pinning was enabled based on the app's behavior during login or account creation attempts.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Kali Linux**: Used for security auditing and penetration testing.
- **Android Emulator**: Simulates Android devices for testing.
- **Burp Suite**: An integrated platform for security testing of web applications.
- **Atom**: A text editor used for inspecting code.
- **Apktool**: A tool for reverse engineering Android apps.

## Application Analysis and Details
The study categorized various mobile applications and analyzed them using both static and dynamic methods. Detailed results and application specifics can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1JW5LTlZQACukgPokLxekEf9vEq3zB1YYPFtAFTzo0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Findings and Conclusion
Certificate pinning can enhance security by preventing MITM attacks but introduces operational complexities. Proper implementation, regular updates, and fallback mechanisms are essential for effective certificate pinning.

### Benefits
- Prevents MITM attacks
- Enhances security

### Challenges
- Operational complexity
- Service disruptions
- Development and maintenance overhead
- Compatibility issues

### Best Practices
- Implement backup pins
- Use soft pinning
- Monitor certificate expiry
- Graceful degradation
- Evaluate risks and benefits
